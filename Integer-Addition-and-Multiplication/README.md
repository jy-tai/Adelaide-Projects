# Integer Addition and Multiplication Algorithms

This directory contains C++ code for performing integer addition and multiplication using the school method and the Karatsuba algorithm.

## Input guidelines

The program takes a single line of input containing three integers separated by spaces: `I1`, `I2`, and `B`.

- **I1**: A non-negative integer up to 100 digits long (without leading zeros, except whe nthe value is 0).
**I2**: A non-negative integer up to 100 digits long (without leading zeros, except whe nthe value is 0).
- **B**: The base for `I1` and `I2`, which must be between 2 and 10, inclusive.
